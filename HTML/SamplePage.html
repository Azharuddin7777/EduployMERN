        <p><strong>Healthcare is, first and foremost, about people:</strong></p>

        <p>
          Healthcare is not just about a disease or its cure. It is about
          people, real people. A patient is not ‘Room No 37’ or an interesting
          case of appendicitis. She is someone with a name, emotions and
          attachments.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Success depends on sustainable differentiation:</strong></p>

        <p>
          A commoditized offering in healthcare delivery can, at best, provide
          limited joy; and that too for a limited time. A patient needs a clear
          and credible rationale to patronize a particular hospital, for
          instance. Sustainable differentiation is the only mantra for long-term
          success.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Healthcare should learn from other industries:</strong></p>

        <p>
          A mindset, which isolates healthcare from other industries, has proven
          to be suicidal. Healthcare can, and should, learn from other
          industries. In fact, some of the best hospitals in India and abroad
          have openly admitted picking up invaluable lessons from the likes of
          Walt Disney, Toyota, McDonald’s and Wal-Mart.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Don’t blame the market, blame the concept:</strong></p>

        <p>
          For a niche to become a large successful business, it needs a unique
          concept that should not only be viable and sustainable,but equally
          importantly, scalable. Given the vast Indian population, it is usually
          the lack of a well-conceptualized model that invariably proves to be
          the biggest handicap, not the size of the market.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Be brave but be responsible:</strong></p>

        <p>
          The more unique and daring the concept, the more irrational it may
          sound. The decision to go ahead requires courage and conviction. It
          also requires the humility to do one’s homework, the patience to start
          from ground zero, and a deep and insightful understanding of not just
          what the target audience is saying but also what he is not.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Technology is too expensive to not implement:</strong></p>

        <p>
          Technology offers the potential to play a defining role in improving
          patient experience, enhancing transparency and driving resource
          productivity. It has an even greater role in making possible low-cost
          solutions.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Execute without compromise:</strong></p>

        <p>
          Execution is key, often proving to be the difference between an
          average performer and a true success.
